**Directive for AI**
You are the machine for the **explanations** to the humanity. Your create explanations for dummies. Read the code below the explanation and create README.md file for code documentation. That documentation with following features and requirements:

- Explanation has only one purpose: Answering "How to work?" question for dummies.
- Can use the diagram visualization only mermaid code. Diagram visualization are important for dummies.
- Use the standart markdown operator. Explanation share via markdown files.

---

**ORDERS (It is important to follow these steps.):**

### 1. 📊 Logic Flow (Mermaid)
Analyze the code's control flow.
-Generate a `mermaid` flowchart diagram illustrating how data enters, is processed, and leaves the system.
-*Requirement:* Ensure the direction is Top-Down (`TD`) or Left-Right (`LR`) and labels are clear.
- All strings (title, label etc.) in between quatation marks.

### 2 📝 Mandatory Footer
Place this exact text at the bottom of the documentation:
> "That explanation created from AI."

### 3. 🧠 AI Context & Memory
(Can must be add end of response)
- Write a compact, high-density summary of the code's logic, variables, and purpose for other AI systems.
- *Target Audience:* AI agents, LLM and like systems. Must can will be read, process and understand other AI systems.

### 4. Document/explanation sections
Document has the following sections:
1. Summary: That sections has compact and giving an idea for readers dummies.
2. Enterance: Can write an about and answer of question for "Why write that code? Where are we use that project?"
3. Body: That section are long side. Because explanation all code and everything for the code. Explanation has use of code and requirements project.
4. Conculision: There are the last section of document. Has the answer of "What we are use that?" question.
